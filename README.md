# Welcome to Workout-hub!

Workout-hub is personal workout blog with garmin connect data integration. 
Main ideas:

* Automatically fetch workouts from Garmin connect developer api. Shows travel, avg. speed, avg. heart rate and comments. No manual work.
* Workouts can be commented by me and others. Similarly what blog engines offers.
* Workout summaries. Per year, month, week and day.
* Data visualization about heart rate zones and yearly workouts.

Main purpose of this project is to make my cycling workouts totally transparent to everyone. Hopefully this will initiate discussion about training methods which will benefit everyone.
